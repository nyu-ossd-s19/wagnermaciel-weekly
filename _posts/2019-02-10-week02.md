title: Week 2

1. Describe your own contributions to your team's efforts of building your browser extension

This week I have contributed by adding the parsing logic for extracting email addresses from the DOM, adding the HTML/CSS for the UI of the extension, and adding the copy functionality (which borrowed heavily from github's clone copy to clipboard).

2. Describe the state of your browser extension project: what progress your team make, what problems you encountered, will you have a working product by the due date

The browser extension is practically finished. We have the core goal of the extension accomplished. An initial problem we encountered was our UX was pretty crummy at the start. We were displaying found emails in an alert, which is not the most user friendly way to do it. We will absolutely have a working project by the due date.

3. Describe at least one thing about git or gitHub that you learned this week (something that was new to you)

I have learned the difference between cloning and forking a repository this week. I always knew there was a difference, and probably could have made a decent educated guess on what the differences were, but it was helpful to finally learn a formalized definition of the two.
