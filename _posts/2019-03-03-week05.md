Anyone can use, copy, change, publish, distribute, sublicense or sell copies of React, with the restriction that these copyright terms and permissions are included in all copies / "substantial portions" (which may be subjective) of React. Also, React doesn't hold any liability in how copies of the software are used.

Installing the dev environment was easy once I found the instructions on how to do so. Turns out there are a few different environments you can set up (some easier than others) for applications of different scales and types.

I noticed a deprecation warning when initializing the environment, so I might check for an issue to fix this, or create an issue and fix the bug myself.
