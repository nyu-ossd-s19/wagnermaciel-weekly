Working with my teamates was pretty fun. We worked remotely but would discuss the project in person before/after class. Decisions about design were pretty free-flowing. We communicated over facebook messenger. Pretty much all of the design aspects were handled by me, but I would always encourage the other members of the group to critique, modify, or even throw out altogether the additions I had made. The most important aspect to our success as a team has definitely been the documentation of our code. The code is well written - i.e. variables are well named and nobody is trying to be too clever at any point - and very well documented. We are operating by creating branches, creating pull requests, asking one of the other members to view the changes, test the branch, and (if they approve of the changes) merge the PR. This has been a slow operation, but it has proven beneficial as it has prevented bugfixes and the like.
