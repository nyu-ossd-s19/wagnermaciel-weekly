Blog about your personal progress towards the team project: what have you done, what did you learn, what are the tasks that you will be working on next week

So far we have worked on figuring out our first issue.
We quickly learned that integrating into the community would be more difficult than we thought.

From your own point of view, what kind of people contribute to Wikipedia?

People with too much time on their hands. Or people who know a lot about specific topics and want other people to have easy access to the information that took them a long time to learn.

Do you think you might one day become a regular contributor?

No.

How will you select the articles to contribute as part of the required contributions for this class?

I'll probably pick a topic that I know a decent amount about and contribute by correcting any incorrect or unclear information.
