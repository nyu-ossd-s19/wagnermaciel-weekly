introduce the project that you selected to evaluate (your own, not the one you worked on in class) and explain why you picked it (why is it interesting to you)

I really wanted to work on GraphQL, but seeing that there aren't any "good first commit" issues open, I decided to take a look at React instead, which currently has three (two labeled to be of medium difficulty and one challenging). I have used the two in the past (react more so than graphql, but I enjoyed using graphql more) so I am hoping to improve my knowledge so I can be a stronger developer.

post your project evaluation (make sure that it is easy to follow by others who may be interested in the same project)
